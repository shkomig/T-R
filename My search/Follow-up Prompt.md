Based on the comprehensive review and key findings you provided, please design a detailed and actionable work plan (PLAN) to stabilize and refactor the trading system. 

Break the PLAN into clear phases:
- Critical hotfixes (immediate risks and code changes)
- Architectural refactoring (modularization, separation of production and simulation code, circuit breakers, error handling, health monitoring)
- Testing & validation (unit tests, integration, audit trail, simulation strategy validation)
- Documentation and team onboarding (readme improvements, code comments, setup guides)

For each task or phase, specify:
- Purpose and measurable outcome
- Estimated timeline and required resources
- Dependencies/risks and sequence/order

Additionally, please create a template example for an MCP (Monitoring, Change, Process) report to track progress and context for each development cycle. The MCP template should contain:
- Change objective & description
- Implementation steps and owners
- Success criteria/result
- Progress status/log
- Notes and issues

Recommend how to update and maintain this MCP report step-by-step during development. Return the PLAN and MCP template as files or Markdown sections for integration into our documentation.
